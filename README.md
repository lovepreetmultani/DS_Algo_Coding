## Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository utilizes various data structures and algorithms to efficiently handle and process data.The following data structures and algorithms are implemented

**Array/String**: Used for storing and accessing data in a contiguous block of memory.

**Linked List**: Implemented as a dynamic data structure for efficient insertion and deletion operations.

**Stack**: Utilized for implementing last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure operations.

**Queue**: Implemented as a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure for efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.

**Binary Search Tree**: Used for efficient searching,insertion,and deletion of elements in a sorted tree structure.

**Hash Table**: Utilized for fast retrieval and storage of key-value pairs.

**Sorting Algorithms**: Implemented sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.

**Graph Algorithms**: Utilized algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) for traversing and analyzing graphs.

These implemented data structures and algorithms facilitate hands-on practice and problem-solving skills.
